## Principles
Signals are derived from historical prices, volumes, and indicators via pattern recognition and ML models.
Core steps: data analysis → pattern recognition → probability estimation, with multi-timeframe, volatility,
and volume-price confirmations.

## Types
- Intraday/Weekly bottoms and tops
- Price/Options alerts

## Grading & performance
- 50%–65%: mild; 65%–80%: moderate; 80%–100%: strong
- Historical: bottoms ~68% avg, tops ~65% (lower during high volatility)
- Personalized stats by symbol/type/timeframe

## Best practices
- Combine with fundamentals and events; avoid single-signal decisions
- Prefer indicator resonance and cross-timeframe consistency
- Diversify watched symbols; review and tune regularly

## Risk management
- Scale in; pyramid adds (with cap)
- Fixed/technical/time-based stop loss
- Adjust position dynamically based on follow-up signals
