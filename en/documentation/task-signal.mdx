title: Task & Technical Signals
description: Principles, types, grading and best practices for technical signals.

## Principles
Signals are derived from historical prices, volumes, and indicators via pattern recognition and ML models.
Core steps: data analysis → pattern recognition → probability estimation, with multi-timeframe, volatility,
and volume-price confirmations.

## Types
- Intraday/Weekly bottoms and tops
- Price/Options alerts

## Grading & performance
- <span class="text-secondary">50%–65%: mild</span>; <span class="highlight-blue">65%–80%: moderate</span>; <span class="positive">80%–100%: strong</span>
- Historical: <span class="highlight-blue">bottoms ~68% avg</span>, <span class="highlight-orange">tops ~65%</span> (lower during high volatility)
- Personalized stats by symbol/type/timeframe

## Best practices
- Combine with fundamentals and events; avoid single-signal decisions
- Prefer indicator resonance and cross-timeframe consistency
- Diversify watched symbols; review and tune regularly

## Risk management
- Scale in; pyramid adds (with cap)
- Fixed/technical/time-based stop loss
- Adjust position dynamically based on follow-up signals
