## Download & install
- Visit openstrat.ai (or use links in the docs during preview)
- Choose your OS:
  - Windows: download .exe and follow the wizard
  - macOS: download .dmg and drag to Applications
  - Linux: install via your distro's package manager

## Sign-in
- Click "Login" and sign in with Google / Apple / Discord
- Token-based auth (time-limited, scoped) for better security; 2FA recommended (available after rollout)

## First run
1. Explore the homepage and left menu (chat, tasks, notification center)
2. From the welcome screen, tap "Tap to Create" to create your first task
3. Allow push notifications (especially on mobile)

## Troubleshooting
▶ Can't sign in: check provider account status and network; try again or switch provider

▶ Need to re-authorize: remove the app in the provider's account settings and re-authorize

▶ Install fails: Windows run as admin; macOS allow in System Settings > Privacy & Security; Linux install required deps per distro
