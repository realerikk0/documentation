# Why Quantitative Investing?

Before diving into technical analysis and investment strategies, we need to answer a fundamental question: **Why do ordinary people need quantitative investing?**

The answer is simple: because humans are naturally bad at investing.

## Three Fatal Flaws of Human Investing

### 1. Emotional Decision-Making: The Greed-Fear Cycle

> **Real scenario**: When prices rise, you think "they'll keep going up" and buy at the top; when prices fall, you fear "they'll keep falling" and panic sell at the bottom.

**Why does this happen?**
- Our brain's reward system creates euphoria when making money, wanting more
- Loss aversion makes us overreact to losses irrationally  
- Herd mentality makes us follow crowds rather than think independently

**Real data**: Studies show 90% of retail investors "buy high, sell low" - the exact opposite of successful investing.

### 2. Information Processing Limitations: Hardware Constraints

**Human brain limitations**:
- Can only focus on analyzing a few stocks at once
- Cannot simultaneously process price, volume, financial data, and news sentiment
- Easily influenced by recent events (availability bias)
- Memory distorts, making historical recall inaccurate

**Institutional advantages**:
- Professional analyst teams
- Advanced data analysis tools
- 24/7 market monitoring
- Massive historical data for decisions

**Reality for retail investors**: You compete against professional teams with part-time effort and limited tools.

### 3. Time and Energy Constraints: Life Beyond Investing

**Real problems**:
- Work during market hours, can't monitor real-time
- Only evenings and weekends for research when markets are closed
- Insufficient time to deeply research every stock
- Can't react quickly to breaking news or earnings releases

**Time cost**: Spending 2 hours daily on stock research equals 730 hours yearly - equivalent to a part-time job, but returns aren't guaranteed to beat professionals.

## How Quantitative Investing Solves These Problems

### 1. Emotional Neutrality: Algorithms Don't Panic

**Algorithm advantages**:
- No greed or fear, strictly follows preset rules
- Won't change strategy due to temporary market fluctuations
- Can buy during maximum panic, sell during maximum greed
- Historical data shows: mechanical execution typically outperforms emotional decisions

**Real example**: During March 2020 COVID crash, most people panic-sold, but quantitative systems identified technical bottoms and started accumulating, capturing the subsequent recovery.

### 2. Data Advantage: Superhuman Information Processing

**Algorithms can simultaneously**:
- Monitor thousands of stocks' real-time price movements
- Analyze each stock's technical indicator status
- Process macroeconomic data and market sentiment indicators
- Identify price patterns invisible to human eyes
- Make buy/sell decisions in milliseconds

**Openstrat's capabilities**:
- Simultaneously monitor 2000 popular US stocks
- Real-time analysis across multiple timeframes
- Identify technical bottom/top probabilities
- 24/7 cryptocurrency market monitoring

### 3. 24/7 Monitoring: The Tireless Market Sentinel

**Algorithm's vigilance**:
- Real-time US market monitoring (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET)
- 24-hour cryptocurrency monitoring
- Global coverage across Asian, European, and American markets
- Immediate analysis and strategy adjustment during breaking events

**Meaning for ordinary investors**: You can sleep peacefully and focus on work while algorithms alert you to optimal investment opportunities.

## Quantitative Investing â‰  Full Automation

**Important reminder**: Quantitative investing doesn't mean blindly following machines, but using scientific methods to assist your investment decisions.

### Correct Quantitative Investing Philosophy

1. **Algorithms handle data processing and pattern recognition**
2. **Humans make final decisions and risk control**
3. **Combine multiple signal sources for higher accuracy**
4. **Continuous learning and strategy optimization**

### Human-Machine Collaboration Advantages

- Algorithms provide objective data analysis
- Humans provide common sense and risk awareness
- Algorithms process technical indicators
- Humans consider fundamentals and macro environment
